\subsection{Dataset selection}

Initially, the dataset of German Tweets referenced in the assignment was used for training the language model for the third part.
However, it turned out to include a non-negligible amount of useless words.
Those include spelling mistakes, English words or made-up words.
Hence it was decided to use sentences from newspapers that are of a much higher quality.
Results immediately improved, with a lot more words being included and similarity making sense.
