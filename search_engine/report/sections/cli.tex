\section{CLI}
\label{sec:cli}

PyInquirer was used to enhance our CLI with the goal of improving usability.
In contrast to prompts using Python's built-in \verb|prompt| method, the CLI will validate user input before it is confirmed.
Thus, users get feedback on invalid input faster.

Presenting selectable options as navigable lists further enhances the user experience.
Instead of selecting their desired entry by inputting some unique identifier (e.g., an entries index in the list), users can make their selection directly while scrolling through lists.
