\section{Stemming}
\label{sec:stemming}

The program is using NLTK's \textit{SnowballStemmer}, configured for the English language.
Using PyCharm's built-in Python profiler we noticed that stemming made up the majority of our execution time at about 60 to 65 percent \footnote{Exact percentage depends on the hardware of the executing machine.}.

To improve our indexing and query time adopted a caching mechanism using a Python dictionary.
With words being used as keys and their stemmed version being the associated value, we were able to reduce the indexing time of a single document by up to 50 percent.
While the dictionary does require additional memory, it is substantially smaller than the inverted index itself.
