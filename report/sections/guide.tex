\section{How to run your Prototype}
\label{sec:guide}

\subsection{Installation}

To run the program, Python 3.8+ and the following libraries are required.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://numpy.org}{NumPy}
  \item \href{https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer}{PyInquirer}
  \item \href{https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit}{prompt\_toolkit}
  \item \href{https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/}{BeautifulSoup}
  \item \href{https://www.nltk.org}{NLTK}
  \item \href{https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/}{termcolor}
\end{itemize}

Downloading the provided dataset and extracting its contents into the \verb|code/dataset| directory is necessary.

\subsection{Usage}

Running \verb|python main.py| will start the program.
If no save data is found in the \verb|code/tables| directory, the program will create a new index for the dataset.
Otherwise, it will load the saved data from the respective files.
Alternatively, running \verb|python main.py -c| or \verb|python main.py --clean| will always create a fresh index.
When a fresh index is being created, the program will ask how many files it is supposed to index.
Entering \verb|-1| will result in all files being indexed.

The menus of the CLI can be navigated using arrow keys.
Selections can be confirmed with the enter key.

\subsubsection{Evaluation mode}

Select \enquote{Evaluation} in the menu to start the evaluation mode.
The program will then run the evaluation mode fully automated, as described in \autoref{sec:results}.

\subsubsection{Exploration mode}

Selecting \enquote{Exploration} in the menu will launch the exploration mode for querying the indexed documents with custom search terms.
After choosing a scoring method and entering a query, the program will present a list of results in descending order.
Selecting an entry will print its contents.
Alternatively, choosing \enquote{Return} will exit the results-view.

\subsubsection{Other}

Selecting \enquote{Reset index} will trigger the creation of a new index without restarting the program.

Selecting \enquote{Exit} will terminate the program.
